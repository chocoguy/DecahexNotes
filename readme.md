# Decahex Notes

This is a webapp used to write, store and share notes and files.

the aim is to make something more barebones and simpler than google keep along with file sharing.

I just need something quick and dirty to share text between computers! Don't want to log into google or dropbox and do some stupid MFA everytime I need to pass over text or a file.

Will work on it when I can, no promises as to when it will be done.
